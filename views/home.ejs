                <br>	
                <p>This dog house is a little different on the inside, no funky smells*, no stale water bowl, no muddy paw prints just fresh beer poring from four taps, a fermenter squeezed in along side a kettle and a mash tun.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                At the Dog & Bone we have enough capacity to brew 38L / 10 Gal / 67 Pints at a time and keg storage for 114L / 25 Gal / 200 Pints. You can be sure to find at least four different kegs on tap with another two usually sitting in the wings or bubbling away in the fermenter. Doors are open to friends, family and free-loaders alike.</p>
                <br>
                <p>*we can't guarantee the smells, some of these hop varieties stink.</p>

                    <h1>Our Story</h1>
                    <p>From humble beginnings to big dog beers. A dynamic duo of two best friends, Rob and Gimli, set out to create a brew space of their own and in late 2019 the Dog & Bone Beer Co was born.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Chief of Biscuit Operations, G is in charge of flavour profiles, mouth feel, and quality control. With years of tasting experience behind him testing some of the finest treats on offer, you can rest assure your treats are in safe paws. Heck this guy is even the logo, that's how much we trust him.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Rob (that's me) does all the hard work, from this website to drinking the produce, you know quality control and all that. I've always enjoyed cask beer and as the beer scene has grown so did my love for kegged beers. I have a particualr thing for a hoppy, fruity IPA's, a sweet spot for a sour and a devotion for the dark stuff. I wanted to learn new skills and home brewing seemed to be the perfect platform to bring them all together, building a brand, coding and of course brewing beer. So follow me and G on our journey, who nows where we will end up, the only gaurantee is there will be beer.</p>

                    <p>Recently a brave soul asked us to bring some kegs to their wedding, after an hour and a half in the boot of my car the beer was less than clear but it was free so of course it went down like a treat. More importantly though we got to test our mobile beer cooler which worked perfectly allowing fresh cold beer to be poured without an electricity source. Keg on the beach anyone?</p>
